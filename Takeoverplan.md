Group 22 Project 1 takeover plan.

Commiting Policy updates:

Looking at the commiting.md we plan to update the policy on how the group will use branching and how we plan on comminting code due to the loose standards that were inheretied.
The group will develope with a git flow workflow, where each group member will work in parralell on a development branch for their feature they are working on. The testing czar
will supervise the branching devopment and make sure that the testing of each implemented feature exists and passes before getting merged back in.

Testing updates:

Organizational Updates: In effort to better stay orgnized we will be using a project board to better keep track of tasks. Additonly issues will be created for larger problems and referenced in tasks due the the feedback given in the Project 1 review.

Youtube Comment Analysis: We intend to add an additional functionality that will not only scrape comments of a Youtube video, but also analyse the intent and sentiment of the comments. This will aid assessment of appropriate video recommendation for particular groups in the future, as well as understand the overall feedback upon a certain video.

User Authentication: This update will include user authentication, login and signup authentication to store the details of a particular user. As an future scope, we plan to keep the history of all the data the user has analyzed the intent for, hence improving analysis.

Coding tasks:

Coding issues have been imported form the previous groups project and have been assigned to team members to take care of. 
- Rushil and Mihir who have data science backgrounds will focus on issues related to the machine learning and data science backend of the codebase
- Muskan and Rucha will work on issues related to front end user designs
- Mihir will handle areas relatated to security and user authentication.
- Rushil will handle Youtube Comment Scraping and Analysis.
- Rucha and Muskan will handle user authentication.
